# 🏦 US Financial Loan Monitoring System

> **A full-stack financial risk analytics project** demonstrating SQL-based portfolio analysis, Python predictive modeling, and Power BI dashboard design aligned with US financial system stability and regulatory risk frameworks.

---

## 📌 Project Overview 

This project simulates an end-to-end **loan portfolio risk monitoring system** for a US financial institution. It covers the entire analytics pipeline, from raw data ingestion to executive-level dashboards modeling real-world frameworks used by banks, credit unions, and fintech risk teams.

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Data Generation | Python (NumPy, Pandas) | Synthetic FDIC-inspired loan dataset |
| Data Storage | Microsoft SQL Server 2019+ | T-SQL schema, indexes, and analytical queries |
| Predictive Model | Python (scikit-learn) | Probability of Default (PD) model |
| Visualization | Power BI | 4-page interactive risk dashboard |

## 📊 Dashboard Pages

### Page 1 - Loan Portfolio Overview
| Metric                  | Description                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Total Loans             | Count of all active loans                           |
| Total Portfolio Balance | Sum of outstanding principal                        |
| Delinquency Rate        | % of loans with any missed payment                  |
| Charge-Off Rate         | % of loans written off as losses                    |
| Loan Mix by Type        | Mortgage, Auto, Personal, Student, SMB, Credit Card |

### Page 2 - Risk Indicators
- **Early Delinquency Trends** - 30-59 DPD rate over origination cohorts (leading indicator)
- **High-Risk Borrower Segments** - Deep Subprime vs Subprime vs Near-Prime vs Prime
- **DTI vs Default** - Debt-to-income concentration analysis
- **Credit Score Distribution** - Performing vs defaulted loan overlap

### Page 3 - Geographic Risk Concentration
- Filled US map colored by state-level delinquency rate
- Risk tier flags: Low / Moderate / High / Critical
- Top 15 states by delinquency exposure

### Page 4 - Predictive Risk Model
- Probability of Default scores (Logistic Regression, AUC ≈ 0.82)
- Expected Loss = PD x Loan Amount
- Risk band classification: Low / Medium / High / Critical
- Top 50 highest-risk loans

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Install Python Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/us-financial-loan-monitoring.git
cd us-financial-loan-monitoring
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Generate the Dataset & Train the PD Model

```bash
python python/01_data_generation.py    # generates 5,000 loan records
python python/03_default_prediction.py # trains model, exports PD scores
```

Outputs to `data/processed/`:
- `loan_portfolio.csv` - 5,000 synthetic loans with realistic risk profiles
- `loan_portfolio_scored.csv` - same dataset with model PD scores added

### 3. Set Up SQL Server

The project uses **Microsoft SQL Server 2019+** (the free Express edition works). See [`docs/setup_guide.md`](docs/setup_guide.md) for the full walkthrough.

**Quick start in SSMS:**

1. Open `sql/01_create_schema.sql` - Execute (F5) - creates the database and tables
2. Open `sql/03_data_ingestion.sql` - update the two file paths - Execute - loads the CSV data
3. Open `sql/02_dashboard_queries.sql` - Execute - runs all KPI queries

### 4. SQL Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `01_create_schema.sql` | Creates `loan_risk_db` database, 3 tables, 7 indexes |
| `02_dashboard_queries.sql` | All KPI queries for the 4 dashboard pages |
| `03_data_ingestion.sql` | Loads CSV data via `BULK INSERT`, stamps model metadata |
| `04_risk_segmentation.sql` | Segment matrix, credit bands, watchlist, vintage analysis |

### 5. Build Power BI Dashboard

See [`powerbi/POWERBI_SETUP.md`](powerbi/POWERBI_SETUP.md) for full step-by-step instructions including data import, DAX measures, and visual layout.

## 📈 Key Findings (Sample Portfolio)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Portfolio Size | 5,000 loans |
| Total Balance | ~$710M |
| Delinquency Rate | 17.0% |
| Charge-Off Rate | 1.5% |
| Avg Credit Score | 700 |
| Model AUC (PD) | 0.82 |

**Top Risk Drivers:**
1. Credit score below 580 (Deep Subprime) - delinquency rate 4-5x portfolio average
2. DTI ratio above 43% - significant non-linear increase in default probability
3. Personal loans and Credit Cards - highest delinquency rates by product type
4. Geographic concentration in select Sun Belt and Rust Belt states
